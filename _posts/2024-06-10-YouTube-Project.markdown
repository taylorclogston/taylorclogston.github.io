A few weeks ago I started working on a project I'm calling *Reading About Writing,* in which I hope to summarize the main ideas from different writing craft books, then provide some additional context regarding how other authors have treated the same idea. My first entry in the project will be *[On Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing)* by Stephen King. For the moment, I've just rebranded my old YouTube writing channel and, under this branding, have produced a single video about editing the writing around you, which you can watch below.

I look forward to continuing to work on this project, especially when I have more mental energy to devote to it.
